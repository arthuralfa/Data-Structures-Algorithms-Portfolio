# Data Structures & Advanced Algorithms (C)

This repository contains core implementations and projects developed for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. It focuses on memory management, algorithm efficiency, and complex logic solving using C.

## 📘 Overview

Each folder contains a standalone project addressing specific challenges in computer science:

* **SAT Solver** – A Boolean satisfiability solver prototype using propositional logic and heuristics.
* **Huffman Coding** – A full data compression tool using frequency-based binary trees and bit manipulation.
* **Red-Black Tree** – A self-balancing binary search tree implementation, ensuring $O(\log n)$ operations.
* **Counting and Plotting** – Data processing and complexity analysis with visual plotting.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/iancarlosct/Projetos-Estrutura-de-Dados.git](https://github.com/iancarlosct/Projetos-Estrutura-de-Dados.git)
2. **Standard C Projects:**

   ```bash
   cd Projetos-Estrutura-de-Dados/(foldername)
   gcc (mainfilename).c -o main
   ./main
   ```
3. Huffman (using makefile):

   ```bash
   make
   ./build/main
   ```

🎯 Academic Purpose
